The company has extensive volume of data stored on its sales, marketing activities, operational/logistic efficiency, product offerings. 
and loyalty program — the latter potentially being underutilized. This project analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover key insights that can enhance Voltmart’s commercial performance. In collaboration with the Head of Operations, I will provide actionable insights and recommendations to cross-functional teams across Sales, Finance, and Product.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales trends and notable seasonal patterns.

### Overview of Findings

Between 2019 and 2022, VoltMart generated $28M in sales from 108K orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. The company experienced its strongest year-over-year growth in 2020, with revenue up 163%, order volume up 101%, and AOV increasing by 31%.

However, the following years showed a downward trend. In 2022, sales declined by 46%, order volume by 40%, and AOV by 10%. While part of this decline can be attributed to the normalization of consumer behavior following the pandemic, the following sections explore additional contributing factors and identify key opportunities for improvement

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
